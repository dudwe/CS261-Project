Made using PHP v7.2.2, MySQLi, and MySQLv15.1 (10.1.31-MariaDB)

To view the database, login using `mysql -u root`, then `use database traderbot_db;` at the prompt.
Use `show tables` to see the tables in the database, and `select * from <table>` to see the stuff in a table.

Note: pop_tables.php doesn't check for the existence of records, so you can just keep adding duplicates. Probably don't do that.
