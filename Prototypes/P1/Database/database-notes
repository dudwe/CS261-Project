Made using PHP v7.2.2, MySQLi, and MySQLv15.1 (10.1.31-MariaDB)

To view the database, login using `mysql -u root`. IF you haven't got a user 'bank' with password
'password', create one by entering `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'`
at the mysql prompt. Then exit using `quit`, and log into the new account with `mysql -u bank -p` and enter
the password 'password' when prompted. To then view the database once it has been created by the php functions,
view its entry by first typing `use traderbot_db;` and then `show tables;` or by writing a `SELECT...` statement.
